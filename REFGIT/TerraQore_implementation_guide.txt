v1.1 · Production Security (Weeks 1‑4)

Prompt injection defense: Add PromptInjectionDefense plus SecurityViolation to core_cli/core/security_validator.py; hook validation into every agent entry point (e.g., coder_agent.py, planner_agent.py) via a lightweight decorator so all user/system prompts are scanned before execution.
Sandboxed execution upgrade: Extend the existing Docker-backed runner in code_executor.py with CPU/memory/time quotas, execution transcripts, and rollback metadata so executor.py can halt workflows on dangerous output.
Hallucination detection: Introduce HallucinationDetector under core_cli/agents/ (or core_cli/agents/hallucination_detector.py) and integrate with code_validator_agent.py to run AST validation, spec matching, and security scans before approving code.
Security regression tests: Stand up tests/security/ with ≥20 prompt-injection fixtures, malicious shell/code samples for the executor, and cross-agent validation tests; wire them into build.ps1 so the “Security First” marketing claim is test-backed.
Docs & collateral: Update FASTAPI_IMPLEMENTATION.md and DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md with a Security section; draft whitepaper outline + comparison page copy for the planned Hacker News launch.
v1.2 · Enterprise Reliability (Weeks 5‑8)

PSMP hardening: Finish dependency conflict handling in agent_specialization_router.py and conflict_resolver_agent.py; emit automatic BLOCKED states plus conflict reports persisted through collaboration_state.py.
Cost transparency: Create core_cli/core/cost_estimator.py to track per-agent/model token spend, budget caps, and provider selection hints; surface summaries through main.py flags and log streams.
Monitoring & health: Add metrics collectors (uptime, latency, token usage, error rates) under core and expose them via CLI dashboards or JSON endpoints so ops teams can script alerts.
Interactive CLI mode: Implement core_cli/cli/interactive_mode.py with approval gates, inline edits, regenerate/skip actions, and approval history persisted to the event log—this ties directly to the human-in-the-loop promise.
v2.0 · Commercial Launch (Weeks 9‑12)

UI prototype: Layer a FastAPI shim in app.py to expose orchestrations; build a React/Vite dashboard in gui/ with project visualization, workflow builder, and approval UI synced to the CLI state machine.
Template system: Add templates/ plus CLI scaffolding commands for the five flagship templates (RAG chatbot, ML pipeline, microservices, FastAPI service, data analysis), ensuring each template bundles PSMP metadata and cost presets.
Documentation & marketing: Refresh comparison pages, security docs, and non-technical onboarding in DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md; script 3‑5 demo videos and draft Product Hunt + blog launch assets aligned with the guide’s talking points.
Launch prep: Build case studies, landing page, and campaign tracking so KPIs (stars, MAUs, conversions, MRR) can be measured immediately after release.
Immediate next steps

Spin up core_cli/core/security_validator.py + injection tests to unblock Week 1.
Scope Docker runtime limits for code_executor.py and gather malicious fixtures.
Flesh out HallucinationDetector interface so validation hooks can land in parallel with security work.
Once these are underway we can groom tickets per week, line up owners, and start tackling the v1.1 backlog.
