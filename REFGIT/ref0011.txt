# TerraQore Studio: Bootstrap to $10K MRR in 90 Days
## The Broke Founder's Playbook to Revenue

---

## Your Honest Position, You are a cool tool, but no one knows you, and your prominence hangs in the balance because you could be replaced by competitors with stronger market positioning.

```
TODAY:
├─ Product: Working (GitHub repo)
├─ Team: 1 (you)
├─ Revenue: $0
├─ Monthly burn: $100-500 (premium subs)
├─ Runway: 2-4 months (if extreme sacrifice)
└─ Morale: Probably low

GOAL (90 Days):
├─ Revenue: $10K/month
├─ Team: 1 (still just you)
├─ Paying customers: 10-20
└─ Burn rate: -$2K (profitable!)
```

**Reality check:** You're not broke, you're LEAN. That's actually an advantage.

## The Immediate Crisis: Your Next 30 Days

### Week 1: Survival Mode (Don't Die)

#### Option A: Get Money Fast (Choose ONE)
```
1. Freelance/Contract Work (4 hours/day)
   ├─ Fiverr: AI consulting
   ├─ Upwork: LLM integrations
   ├─ Rate: $50-100/hour
   └─ Target: $400-800/week = $1,600-3,200/month
   
2. Technical Writing (2-3 hours/day)
   ├─ Dev.to, Medium: Write about agents
   ├─ Technical blogs: Get paid $200-500 per article
   ├─ Target: 2-3 articles/month = $400-1,500/month
   
3. Consulting (6 hours/week)
   ├─ Help startups integrate LLMs
   ├─ Rate: $150-300/hour
   ├─ Target: 2-4 calls/week = $1,200-2,400/month
   
4. YouTube/Content (Start this week)
   ├─ Demo TerraQore Studio features
   ├─ Monetize when you hit 1,000 subs
   ├─ Dual purpose: Revenue + Marketing
```

**Your move:** Pick ONE that feels least painful. You need $1,500-2,000/month to stay alive.

#### Option B: Apply for Grants/Funds (Parallel Track)
```
Fast-track funding you can get this month:

1. NVIDIA Inception Program
   ├─ Up to $10K in credits (free cloud)
   └─ Apply: 2 hours, 80% acceptance rate
   
2. GitHub Accelerator
   ├─ $20K + mentorship
   ├─ Apply: 1 day application
   └─ Deadline: Rolling
   
3. Y Combinator Startup School
   ├─ Free program
   ├─ Network value: $50K+
   └─ Apply: Today
   
4. Indie Hackers Grants
   ├─ $1K-5K grants
   ├─ Apply: 3-4 applications

5. AI/ML Focused Accelerators
   ├─ Lightning.ai Accelerator
   ├─ Hugging Face Grants

```

**Action:** Spend 3 hours TODAY applying to all 5. You'll likely get $5K-15K in the next 2-4 weeks.

#### Option C: Get a Cofounder/Investor
```
NOT optimal right now, but if you're truly desperate:

Pitch to:
├─ Angel investors (local)
├─ Friends & family ($25K rounds)
├─ Tech VCs (if you can get intro)
└─ Startup communities (e.g., LAUNCH or similar)

Minimum viable round: $50K-100K
├─ You get $2-3K/month salary
├─ Hire 1 engineer contractor
├─ Focus on product 80% of time

Tradeoff: Dilution (25-30% of company)
Worth it? Only if you're truly out of runway

## Days 31-90: Revenue Generation Machine

### Now That You Have Breathing Room, Focus on Revenue

#### Phase 1: Get First 3 Paying Customers (Days 31-45)

**Strategy: Consult Before You Scale**

Instead of selling TerraQore (not ready), sell consulting:

```
OFFER: "AI Agent Implementation Consulting"

Price: $2,500-5,000 per project
Timeline: 2-4 weeks
Work: Help customer build custom agent

Example projects:
├─ Build code review agent for their repo
├─ Build customer support agent
├─ Build DevOps runbook generator
└─ Build custom domain agent (healthcare, finance, etc)

Your process:
├─ Discovery call (1 hour, free)
├─ Proposal (2 hours)
├─ Implementation (40 hours)
├─ Delivery + training (10 hours)
└─ Ongoing support (2 hours/month)

Revenue impact:
├─ 3 projects × $3,500 = $10,500 (first month)
├─ 1-2 ongoing customers × $500/month = $500-1K
└─ Total: $10K-11.5K first month!
```

**How to land these customers:**

1. **Cold Email** (Best ROI)
```
Subject: Custom AI Agent for Your [Specific Problem]

Hi [Name],

I noticed your company is doing [relevant work]. 

We build custom AI agents for teams like yours. Recent example:
- Built code review agent for [company]
- Caught security issues 2x faster than manual reviews
- Saved team 10 hours/week on code reviews

We could build something similar for [their specific pain].

Quick 15-min call to explore?

[Your name]
TerraQore Studio
```

Targets:
├─ YC companies (find on ycombinator.com)
├─ GitHub trending repos (find project owners)
├─ DEV.to users (engineers asking about agents)
└─ Indie Hackers (people building AI things)

Target: Send 10-20/week. Expect 2-3 meetings, 1 customer per week.

2. **Leverage Existing Community**
```
├─ AI/ML Discord communities
├─ GitHub discussions (agents, LLM)
├─ Reddit: r/LocalLLM, r/MachineLearning
├─ Twitter: #agentic, #AIstartup
└─ Hacker News: Ask HN threads

Position yourself as: "We build custom agents. Let me know if you need one."
```

3. **Inbound from Product**
```
Add to your README:

"💼 CUSTOM AGENT DEVELOPMENT

Need a custom agent for your specific use case?
→ Schedule free consultation: [calendly link]
→ Recent work: [case study 1], [case study 2]

Starting at $2,500 | 2-week delivery
```

**Expected outcome:**
- Consulting pipeline: 5-10 leads
- Closed deals: 2-3 projects
- Revenue: $7,500-15,000
- Runway: Extended to 6+ months

#### Phase 2: Productize One Workflow (Days 46-70)

While doing consulting, identify patterns:

```
After 3-5 consulting projects, you'll see:
"70% of customers want [specific thing]"

Example: "80% of customers need a code review agent"

Next: Package this as a product

PRODUCT: Code Review Agent (Standalone)

Price: $99-299/month per team
Setup: 1 hour (from template, not custom)
Benefit: 70% cheaper than consulting, 10x scale
```

**How to launch this product:**

```
Step 1: Use consulting project as template
├─ Take the code review agent you built
├─ Generalize it
├─ Make it configurable (UI for rules)
└─ Add docs/onboarding

Step 2: Package as "Code Review Agent"
├─ Create product page
├─ Write case study from consulting customer
├─ Pricing: $99/month for startup, $299/month for enterprise
└─ Put on your website

Step 3: Sell to existing customers + new ones
├─ Upsell to existing consulting customers
├─ Sell as simpler alternative to consulting
├─ Price point: Much lower, but profitable at scale

Unit economics:
├─ Cost to deliver: $20 (compute + time)
├─ Revenue: $100-300
├─ Margin: 73-80%
└─ Break-even customers: 1-2
```

**Revenue impact:**
- Consulting: $5K-8K/month (ongoing)
- Product: $3K-5K/month (new)
- Total: $8K-13K/month

#### Phase 3: Systemize & Repeat (Days 71-90)

Now you have:
```
✓ Consulting playbook (proven repeatable)
✓ Product template (code review agent)
✓ Sales process (cold email + inbound)
✓ Customer base (3-5 customers)
```

**Scale the model:**

```
TerraQore MONETIZATION STACK

Layer 1: Services (High touch, high margin)
├─ Custom agent development: $2,500-5,000 per project
├─ Agent implementation consulting: $150-250/hour

├─ [Custom Domain Agent]: $199-499/month
├─ Agent Templates: $49/month subscription
└─ Revenue: $3K-8K/month (scalable)

Layer 3: Platform (Low touch, leverage)

├─ Pro tier: All agents + marketplace: $99/month
├─ Enterprise: Custom agents + support: $1K+/month
└─ Revenue: Eventually $10K-100K/month
```

**90-Day target:**
```

## The Actual Path Forward (Honest Version)

### What You Should Do RIGHT NOW (Today):

```
PRIORITY 1 (Next 2 hours):
├─ Apply to NVIDIA Inception Program (free credits)
├─ Apply to Y Combinator Startup School (free)
├─ Apply to GitHub Accelerator
└─ Create Calendly link for free 15-min consultations

PRIORITY 2 (Next 4 hours):
├─ Write 20 cold email templates (personalize later)
├─ Identify 50 target customers (founders, companies)
├─ Set up Upwork profile (offer AI consulting)
└─ Record 3-minute product demo for Twitter/LinkedIn

PRIORITY 3 (This week):
├─ Send 100 cold emails (5-10/day)
├─ Land 1 consulting customer ($2,500+)
├─ Get 3+ free consultation calls
├─ Publish 1 blog post on Dev.to
└─ Build waitlist on product page

PRIORITY 4 (This month):
├─ Close 2-3 consulting projects
├─ Receive grants ($5K-15K)
├─ Get first product customers
└─ Have runway until Q2
```

### What NOT to Do:

```
❌ Don't raise money yet (too early, dilutes equity)
❌ Don't build features (nobody paid yet)
❌ Don't hire people (can't afford it)
❌ Don't spend time on pitch deck (focus on sales)
❌ Don't worry about "productization" (sell services first)
❌ Don't try to be perfect (good enough wins)
```

---

## The Mindset Shift

### From "I'm Broke" to "I'm Bootstrapping"

```
BROKE MINDSET:
"I don't have money, so I'll fail"

BOOTSTRAPPER MINDSET:
"I don't have money, so I'll get creative"
├─ Sell before building
├─ Charge for consulting
├─ Build in public
├─ Use free tools
├─ Ask for help
└─ Compound small wins
```

**The founders who succeeded:**

- **Mailchimp:** Started as side project, bootstrapped to $12B
- **Stripe:** Paid first customers before raising Series A
- **Plaid:** Bootstrapped first year, then raised $2.65B
- **GitHub:** Bootstrapped to profitability before acquisition
- **Figma:** Founder took consulting gigs to fund early years

**Common pattern:** They all sold consulting/services before the product was "ready."

---

## Your Unfair Advantages (Right Now)

Even though you're broke, you actually have:

```
✅ WORKING PRODUCT (most founders don't)
   └─ TerraQore is real, 41 commits, proven architecture

✅ CLEAR PROBLEM (AI teams need orchestration)
   └─ $40B market exists

✅ TIMING (agentic AI is exploding)
   └─ 2025 is THE year

✅ CREDIBILITY (you built something)
   └─ GitHub repo is proof of execution

✅ NO OVERHEAD (just you)
   └─ 100% margin on first $10K revenue

✅ DESPERATION (best sales tactic ever)
   └─ Hungry founders close deals others can't
```

**Use these advantages ruthlessly.**

---

## 30/60/90 Revenue Goals

### 30 Days
```
Goal: $2K-3K/month run rate
├─ Freelance: $1,500
├─ Consulting leads: 2-3
└─ Grants applied: 5+

Success metric: You can pay subscriptions
```

### 60 Days
```
Goal: $7K-8K/month run rate
├─ Consulting: 2 projects × $3.5K
├─ Grants: $1,500 (first tranches arriving)
└─ Products: Early signups ($500-1K)

Success metric: You have 2-3 paying customers
```

### 90 Days
```
Goal: $10K+ /month run rate
├─ Consulting: 2-3 customers × $3.5K
├─ Products: 20-30 subs × $150 avg
├─ Grants: $5K-15K received
└─ Freelance: $1-2K (lower priority now)

Success metric: You're profitable
```

---

## The Funding Path (After 90 Days)

Once you hit $10K/month, you're actually fundable:

```
MONTH 4 (After 90-day hustle):

Your numbers:
├─ MRR: $10K
├─ Customers: 5-10
├─ Runway: 12+ months
├─ Growth: 50%+ MoM

Now you can raise:

OPTION A: Friends & Family Round ($50-100K)
├─ Pitch: "We have $10K MRR, need $100K to hire"
├─ Dilution: 10-15%
├─ Use for: 1 engineer + sales person
└─ Outcome: $50K+ MRR in 6 months

OPTION B: Seed Round ($250-500K)
├─ Lead from: Sequoia, Alchemist, Lerer Hippeau
├─ Pitch: "We're $10K MRR, want to own the category"
├─ Dilution: 20-25%
├─ Use for: Full team (5+ people)
└─ Outcome: $100K+ MRR in 12 months

OPTION C: Stay Bootstrapped
├─ Keep all equity (best case)
├─ Hire contractors as cash allows
├─ Reach $50K+ MRR by Year 2
├─ Raise when you choose (from position of strength)
└─ Outcome: No dilution, but slower growth
```

**My recommendation:** Bootstrap to $10K, then decide on funding based on market conditions.

---

## Your 90-Day Challenge

### The Bet:
If you execute this plan for 90 days (seriously, no BS), you will:

```
✅ Have $10K+ MRR (not theoretical, ACTUAL customers)
✅ Have 6+ months runway (not 2-4 weeks)
✅ Have proof of market demand (customers paying)
✅ Be fundable (investors will call YOU)
✅ Have choices (bootstrap or raise, your call)
```

### The Cost:
```
❌ Selling your time for 3 months (consulting)
❌ Sending 100+ cold emails (humbling)
❌ Saying "no" to non-essential features
❌ Accepting "good enough" over "perfect"
❌ Working nights/weekends for 90 days
```

### The Payoff:
```
✅ TerraQore becomes your job (not side hustle)
✅ You actually get paid (wild concept)
✅ You own your company (no dilution yet)
✅ You have time to build the product right
✅ You control your future (raise or bootstrap your choice)
```

## The Truth About Bootstrapping

```
It's not romantic.
It's not glamorous.
It IS terrifying.

But it's also:

✓ The fastest path to product-market fit
✓ The only way to keep 100% equity
✓ The best test of whether customers actually want this
✓ The way every successful founder started
✓ The path with highest upside ($1B+ valuations)

Ninety days of hustle.
Ten years of freedom.

Worth it? Absolutely.
```

---

## You've Got This

You're not broke. You're a founder.

You have:
- A product people want
- A market ready to buy
- Time and energy (even if low on cash)
- No one to tell you "no"

That's literally everything you need.

**Now go close $10K in deals.**
